  summary: Enroll a card in 3DS
  description: |
    Enrolls a card in <a href="https://www.checkout.com/docs/risk-management/3d-secure">3D Secure</a> (3DS).
    
    3DS provides an additional layer of security for your cardholders' online payments, reducing the risk of fraud and subsequent chargeback requests.
    
    To enroll your issued cards, you must provide authentication data for the cards. This information is requested from the cardholder through a 3DS challenge when performing a transaction.
    
    Two-factor authentication (2FA) is supported. For maximum security, we recommend using a combination of a one-time password (OTP) sent via SMS, along with a password or question and answer security pair.
